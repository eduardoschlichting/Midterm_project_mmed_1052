				<h4>Aste - Brand and UI Design</h4>
				
				<p>AstÃª is an online store for women's underwear. Their goal today is to show to their customers how important it is to wear a comfortable and quality garment that makes them feel self-confident and beautiful.</p> 

				<p>The brand was designed for middle-class women, always looking to feel good and improve self-esteem.</p>

				<p>For the logo, a typography with a light serif was chosen, which conveys elegance and modernity. A heart was inserted between the S and the T in negative space, which brings even more personality to the brand, representing self-confidence and self-esteem.</p>

				<p>The logo translates in a clean and minimalist way everything that the brand represents: elegance, modernity, simplicity and self-confidence.</p>
